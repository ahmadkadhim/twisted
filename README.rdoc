TwistingKnobs.com

Twisted is planned to be a Ruby on Rails replacement for my personal portfolio, currently a password-protected site at Squarespace.

Twisted is still in the design stages, so no code has been written yet.

As soon as a premilinary design is completed, I will start to build the back-end and code the design in HTML/CSS.
